# Google AdSense Approval Action Plan
**Rejection Date:** December 2025  
**Rejection Reason:** Low value content / Minimum content requirements not met  
**Target:** Transform site to meet Google Publisher Network standards

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Why We Were Rejected

**"Low Value Content" means:**
1. **Thin content pages** - Calculator tool pages have minimal explanatory text
2. **Insufficient depth** - Pages don't provide enough unique, original insights
3. **Poor user engagement** - No interactive elements beyond the calculator
4. **Template-like structure** - Blog posts may appear formulaic
5. **Lack of expertise signals** - Need more authoritative, expert content

**Google's Expectations:**
- **Minimum 20-30 high-quality pages** with substantial unique content (we have 25 URLs but some are thin)
- **1000+ words per page** for main content pages (our calculator pages are too short)
- **Original research, data, or insights** not found elsewhere
- **Strong user engagement** signals (time on site, pages per session)
- **Clear expertise and authority** in the niche
